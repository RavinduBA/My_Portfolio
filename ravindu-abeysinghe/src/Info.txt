Header

- In the `Header.jsx` component, the `useState` hook is used to manage the visibility of the mobile navigation menu. 
- It initializes a boolean state variable called `navOpen` with a default value of `false`, meaning the menu is initially closed.
- When the user clicks the menu button, the `setNavOpen` function toggles the value between `true` and `false`, which updates the UI accordingly. 
- This state determines whether the `Navbar` component is shown and also changes the button icon from 'menu' to 'close' based on the current state.


Navbar

- useRef is used to hold references to DOM elements (like links and the active-box div).
- Navbar function receives a prop called navOpen (a boolean) that controls whether the navbar is visible.
- navItems is an array of navigation link details (like Home, About, etc.).
- .map() goes through each item in the array and renders an <a> link for it.

What is useRef?
useRef() gives you a box you can store something in — usually a DOM element (like a div or a tag) — and that box won't get reset when your component re-renders.
In this code, you're using it to track HTML elements on the screen — specifically:
The currently active link (like “Home”)
The moving highlight box that follows the active link

🧩 How It Works in Your Code
✅ const lastActiveLink = useRef();
This is used to remember which link was last clicked.
It lets you:
Remove the 'active' class from the old link
Add 'active' to the new one
Move the highlight box to the new link

Why use useRef instead of state?
If you used useState for this, changing it would cause a full re-render — slower and less efficient.
useRef is perfect when you need to touch the DOM directly, like with .style, .offsetTop

What is useEffect?
useEffect is a React hook that runs code after your component renders.
🧨 Think of it as:
“Do something after the page loads or updates.”
🧠 Why is this important?
When your page loads:
The highlight box (<div class="active-box">) needs to know where to start.
useEffect(initActiveBox, []) makes sure it's in the right position from the start.
Without it, the box might:
Not show up in the right place
Be invisible
Appear suddenly when you click
